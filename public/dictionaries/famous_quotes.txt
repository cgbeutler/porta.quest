One year's seeding makes seven years weeding
Learn a language, and you will avoid a war
Least said, soonest mended
You have made your bed and you must lie in it
Where there is life there is hope
Keep your friends close and your enemies closer
The bread never falls but on its buttered side
Talk is cheap
Half a loaf is better than no bread at all
He who can, does; he who cannot, teaches
Once bitten, twice shy
Fall seven times, stand up eight
Live for today, for tomorrow never comes
In for a penny, in for a pound
Moderation in all things
It takes one to know one
Never look a gift horse in the mouth
Better to travel hopefully than to arrive
If it were a snake, it would have bit you
Waste not, want not
The old wooden spoon beats me down
Every man for himself and the Devil take the hindmost
Handsome is as handsome does
Whom the Gods love die young
No accounting for bad taste
No rest for the wicked
Wonders will never cease
Let the cat out of the bag
All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy
The truth will out
If you cannot beat them, join them
No time like the present
The customer is always right
Every cloud has a silver lining
One good turn deserves another
The shoemaker's son always goes barefoot
The apple does not fall far from the tree
Seeing is believing
Kill the chicken to scare the monkey
Don't cry over spilled milk
The grass is always greener on the other side
Better to light a candle than to curse the darkness
Well done is better than well said
From the sublime to the ridiculous is only a step
Tomorrow is another day
Easy come, easy go
Better to reign in hell than serve in heaven
Business before pleasure
A rolling stone gathers no moss
Never judge a book by its cover
Don't wash your dirty linen in public
Don't sympathize with those who can not empathize
Good for the goose is good for the gander
It is never too late
Feed a cold, starve a fever
Keep your chin up
Other times other manners
Never say die
Any publicity is good publicity
What goes around, comes around
The stupid monkey knows not to eat the banana skin
Finders keepers losers weepers
Rules were made to be broken
The more the merrier
Turn your face toward the sun and the shadows fall behind you
Marry in haste, repent at leisure
East, west, home is best
One man's trash is another man's treasure
No news is good news
Don't put the cart before the horse
You cannot make bricks without straw
Play stupid games, win stupid prizes
Pride comes before a fall
It ain't over till it's over
Many hands make light work
The apple never falls far from the tree
You scratch my back and I will scratch yours
One hand washes the other
A man's home is his castle
Cross the stream where it is shallowest
Money makes the devil dance
Don't judge a book by its cover
Don't let the grass grow beneath your feet
Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery
At the end of my rope
United we bargain; divided we beg
Give the devil his due
Don't cross the bridge till you come to it
Idle hands are the devil's playthings
In the midst of life, we are in death
The age of miracles is past
The streets are paved with gold
Possession is nine-tenths of the law
Hope springs eternal
The good die young
Don't cut off your nose to spite your face
Beauty is only skin deep
Cheese, wine, and friends must be old to be good
You pay your money and you take your choice
Whatever floats your boat
Little things please little minds
If you want a thing done well, do it yourself
Knowledge is power, guard it well
Enough is as good as a feast
Tomorrow never comes
Time and tide wait for no man
Strike while the iron is hot
You cannot push a rope
Spare the rod and spoil the child
An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure
A little learning is a dangerous thing
The pen is mightier than the sword
Fortune favours the brave
The proof is in the pudding
Life is what you make of it
Into every life a little rain must fall
Revenge is a dish best served cold
Cold hands, warm heart
Give credit where credit is due
All things come to those who wait
Burn the candle at both ends
No such thing as a free lunch
He who hesitates is lost
With great power comes great responsibility
Eat, drink and be merry, for tomorrow we die
They that sow the wind shall reap the whirlwind
Beggars cannot be choosers
Jack of all trades, master of one
Money talks
Life is not all rainbows and butterflies
It is easy to be wise after the fall
The best things in life aren't free
It's all grist to the mill
Don't let the bastards grind you down
Once the poison, twice the charm
Cream rises to the top
A watched man never plays
Better the Devil you know than the Devil you do not
Put the cart before the horse
One kind word can warm three winter months
It is the last straw that breaks the camel's back
Don't teach your Grandmother to suck eggs
Life is short; do something that matters
He who lives by the sword, dies by the sword
A watched pot never boils
You can't always get what you want
A leopard cannot change its spots
Where there's a will there's a way
You cannot teach an old dog new tricks
Like a snake in the grass
If the eye does not see the heart does not crave
Don't spend it all in one place
To err is human, to forgive divine
Do as I say, not as I do
Two can play at that game
Those who sleep with dogs will rise with fleas
It is like juggling sand
Don't make a mountain out of a mole hill
If anything can go wrong, it will
Clothes make the man
If you've got it, flaunt it
The enemy of my enemy is my friend
When the cat is away, the mice will play
Know which side your bread is buttered on
All's well that ends well
Hope for the best, and prepare for the worst
Discretion is the better part of valour
Well begun is half done
Don't kill the goose that lays the golden eggs
Many a true word is spoken in jest
Kill two birds with one stone
What cannot be cured must be endured
Money earned by deceit, goes by deceit
The spouse is always the last to know
All the world loves a lover
The way to someone's heart is through their stomach
He who fights and runs away, may live to fight another day
Every man has his price
The road to Hell is paved with good intentions
Revenge is sweet
Give the devil her due
Marriages are made in heaven
The labourer is worthy of his hire
You cannot unscramble eggs
Don't put off until tomorrow what you can do today
All things must pass
Loose lips sink ships
All is fair in love and war
Children should be seen and not heard
Don't throw the baby out with the bathwater
Third time's the charm
Shiny are the distant hills
Nothing ventured, nothing gained
Never say never
Don't burn your bridges behind you
No shame in not knowing, but in not finding out
Procrastination is the thief of time
No such thing as bad publicity
Never let the sun go down on your anger
A friend to everyone is a friend to no one
Two wrongs do not a right make
Never speak ill of the dead
Hard work never did anyone any harm
Let bygones be bygones
The darkest hour is just before the dawn
Too little, too late
The last drop makes the cup run over
Better to light a candle than curse the darkness
While there is life there is hope
Walnuts and pears you plant for your heirs
United we stand, divided we fall
Give a dog a bad name and hang him
Familiarity breeds contempt
Even from a foe a man may learn wisdom
It's a small world
Haste makes waste
If you play with fire, you will get burned
Practice what you preach
The longest day must have an end
Cowards may die many times before their death
Absolute power corrupts absolutely
Money is not everything
Oil and water do not mix
Another day, another dollar
History repeats itself
Boys will be boys
You cannot run with the hare and hunt with the hounds
Comparisons are odious
Bad news travels fast
Less is more
Any port in a storm
The course of true love never did run smooth
Absolute power corrupts absolutely
If a job is worth doing, it is worth doing well
It goes without saying
Never give a sucker an even break
Uneasy lies the head that wears a crown
Even a worm will turn
Some are more equal than others
Nothing succeeds like success
No accounting for tastes
A mill cannot grind with the water that is past
Knock on wood
Stupid is as stupid does
A friend in need is a friend indeed
Parsley seed goes nine times to the Devil
Nature abhors a vacuum
Misery loves company
Coffee and love taste best when hot
Love makes the world go around
Count your blessings
Use it or lose it
No friends but the mountains
All you need is love
When you've seen one, you've seen them all
A late lunch makes the day go faster
As a tree bends, so shall it grow
To the victor go the spoils
More ways than one to skin a cat
There is an exception to every rule
Blood is thicker than water
Fine feathers make fine birds
Don't dish it if you can't take it
Necessity is the mother of invention
Where there is muck there is brass
The cobbler always wears the worst shoes
Don't upset the apple-cart
Ugly is as ugly does
Ignorance is bliss
It will be the same a hundred years hence
Better late than never
One swallow does not make a summer
Laugh before breakfast, cry before supper
Honour among thieves
Time is money
Money makes the world go around
Jack of all trades, master of none
Virtue is its own reward
An eye for an eye makes the whole world blind
Good things come to those who wait
Let the punishment fit the crime
The best condiments are authentic flavors
The comeback is greater than the setback
More haste, less speed
No smoke without fire
Like trying to grow a goose
Only time will tell
First come, first served
Speak of the devil and he shall appear
Ask a silly question and you will get a silly answer
The walls have eyes
No use locking the stable door after the horse has bolted
A chain is only as strong as its weakest link
Birds of a feather flock together
Separate the wheat from the chaff
Ask no questions and hear no lies
Speak softly and carry a big stick
The more things change, the more they stay the same
All is grist that comes to the mill
Don't count your chickens before they've hatched
To be worn out is to be renewed
Cheaters never prosper
One man's meat is another man's poison
Every little bit helps
Needs must when the devil drives
False friends are worse than open enemies
As you sow so shall you reap
What goes up must come down
Fake it till you make it
Great minds think alike
Time flies when you're having fun
Hindsight is always twenty-twenty
Man proposes, heaven disposes
Everyone has their price
Cut your coat according to your cloth
Let sleeping dogs lie
Big fish eat little fish
A dog is a man's best friend
The best-laid schemes of mice and men often go awry
The hand that rocks the cradle rules the world
You will never get if you never go
Truth is stranger than fiction
Better to have loved and lost
To each his own
The rich get richer and the poor get poorer
Youth is wasted on the young
Don't put too many irons in the fire
Fair exchange is no robbery
All hands on deck
Doubt is the beginning, not the end, of wisdom
Never let the truth get in the way of a good story
Put your money where your mouth is
You cannot make a silk purse from a sow's ear
Out of sight, out of mind
Variety is the spice of life
Live and let live
If the shoe fits, wear it
Patience is a virtue
Easier said than done
The left hand knows not what the right hand is doing
Only fools and horses work
Hard cases make bad law
When life gives you lemons, make lemonade
Why keep a dog and bark yourself?
A watched kettle never boils
He who sups with the Devil should have a long spoon
Mud sticks
Sleep with the dogs and rise with fleas
Let your hair down
Give him an inch and he will take a mile
A penny saved is a penny earned
A bad workman blames his tools
Every stick has two ends
Speak as you find
Music has charms to soothe the savage beast
You must have rocks in your head
The longest journey starts with a single step
Practice makes perfect
Laughter is the best medicine
Money does not grow on trees
There is no place like home
The empty can makes the most noise
When it rains it pours
Kill the goose that lays the golden eggs
Fight fire with fire
A fool and his money are soon parted
What does not kill me makes me stronger
Let not the sun go down on your wrath
Dead men tell no tales
Don't change horses in midstream
No fool like an old fool
To travel hopefully is a better thing than to arrive
An army marches on its stomach
Open confession is good for the soul
Physician, heal thyself
Clothes don't make the man
Don't look a gift horse in the mouth
The squeaky wheel gets the grease
Lightning never strikes the same place twice
You catch more flies with honey than with vinegar
Where there is smoke there is fire
Sit crooked and talk straight
Every dog has his day
Let well enough alone
See no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil
An apple a day keeps the doctor away
You cannot get blood out of a stone
Right or wrong, my country
No pain, no gain
Worrying never did anyone any good
Don't try to walk before you can crawl
There's no such thing as a free lunch
Easy, times easy, is still easy
Don't keep a dog and bark yourself
Brevity is the soul of wit
Too much of a good thing
The bigger they are, the harder they fall
The early bird catches the worm
The innocent seldom find an uncomfortable pillow
Don't bite the hand that feeds you
The Moon is made of green cheese
Don't shut the stable door after the horse has bolted
Love of money is the root of all evil
Put your best foot forward
Absence makes the heart grow fonder
The pot is calling the kettle black
Don't put all your eggs in one basket
If it were not for hope the heart would break
When the going gets tough, the tough get going
Not all those who wander are lost
Make hay while the sun shines
Curiosity killed the cat
Love will find a way
Two is company, but three is a crowd
Speech is silver but Silence is golden
Failing to plan is planning to fail
Like father, like son
If you lie down with dogs, you will get up with fleas
Look before you leap
Talk of Angels, and hear the flutter of wings
He who pays the piper calls the tune
Many a slip 'twixt cup and lip
Fish always rots from the head downwards
What is learned in the cradle lasts to the tomb
Don't meet troubles half-way
Too many cooks spoil the broth
Pearls of wisdom
Preaching to the choir
Accidents will happen
There is one born every minute
One law for the rich and another for the poor
Unity is strength
Safety in numbers
Crime does not pay
You are never fully dressed without a smile
You cannot have your cake and eat it too
Many a good tune played on an old fiddle
A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush
Time is the greatest healer
Die a hero or live to see yourself the villain
Actions speak louder than words
He who laughs last laughs longest
Manners maketh man
A stitch in time saves nine
Never give advice unless asked
The walls have ears
Walk softly but carry a big stick
Flattery will get you nowhere
Devil take the hindmost
It will come back and haunt you
Two wrongs do not make a right
The best defense is a good offense
The die is cast
Up a creek without a paddle
Set a thief to catch a thief
Fools rush in where angels fear to tread
An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth
Fish and guests smell after three days
Beauty is in the eye of the beholder
A rising tide lifts all boats
April showers bring May flowers
The Devil looks after his own
If at first you don't succeed, try, try again
Seek and ye shall find
Woe to the vanquished
Adversity makes strange bedfellows
You are what you eat
Make love not war
If it ain't broke, don't fix it
If wishes were horses, beggars would ride
You cannot make an omelette without breaking eggs
There are always more fish in the sea
The Devil finds work for idle hands to do
Too much of a good thing
Two birds with one stone
Empty vessels make the most noise
Good talk saves the food
Memory is the treasure of the mind
Good fences make good neighbors
The only way to find a friend is to be one
You are never too old to learn
Fortune favours the bold
Better to give than to receive
Don't rock the boat
If you cannot be good, be careful
Zeal without knowledge is fire without light
Barking dogs seldom bite
Milking the bull
Who will bell the cat?
All good things must come to an end
Die a hero or live long enough to become the villain
No man is an island
No guts, no glory
A picture is worth a thousand words
There are two sides to every question
Tell the truth and shame the Devil
The end justifies the means
If you pay peanuts, you get monkeys
Little strokes fell great oaks
Out of the frying pan and into the fire
Better safe than sorry
The exception which proves the rule
Shrouds have no pockets
Genius is an infinite capacity for taking pains
Respect is not given, it is earned
The best things in life are free
Home is where the heart is
Nothing is certain but death and taxes
It ain't over till the fat lady sings
Still waters run deep
It takes a thief to catch a thief
Men are blind in their own cause
Sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander
First impressions are the most lasting
God helps those who help themselves
Time is a great healer
A bad excuse is better than none
Careless talk costs lives
Honesty is the best policy
Forewarned is forearmed
Opportunity never knocks twice at any man's door
Christmas comes but once a year
No names, no pack-drill
Mighty oaks from little acorns grow
Two heads are better than one
All that glitters is not gold
Slow and steady wins the race
A penny wise and a pound foolish
You can't win them all
There are more ways to kill a cat than choking it with cream
The work praises the man
All good things come to him who waits
The proof of the pudding is in the eating
Give a man rope enough and he will hang himself
It takes a village to raise a child
Born with a silver spoon
Let the buyer beware
The early bird that gets the worm"
